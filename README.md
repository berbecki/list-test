# Testing task

Create an Angular application that displays a list of 100000 
items from endpoint /listeners. Use a shared KOA API - you can extend and change it.

### In the context of this task, consider:
1. Generic solution for handling asynchronous data loading states
2. Pagination or 'virtual' scroll
3. Simple search on top of the list
4. Errors handling

Feel free to use any library if you need. The target look in your decision.

Good luck!
